This directory or its subdirectories should contain OpenVPN
configuration files each having an extension of .ovpn
that should be automatically started at boot up.

When OpenVPNService is started, a separate OpenVPN
process will be instantiated for each configuration file.

OpenVPN GUI does not scan this directory.
